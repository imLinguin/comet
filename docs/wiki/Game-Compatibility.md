# Game Compatibility

As this is a work-in-progress replacement, not all GOG Galaxy feature enabled games may function as expected. You can use `CTRL+F` to search for the game you would like to learn more about its compatibility.

<summary>Steps</summary>

- Copy the last column of the table
- Edit the following information for your tested game compatibility:
  - Game Title (with the GOG storefront linked to it as a Hyperlink, in the following format: `[Game's name](GOG url here)`)
  - Game Version
    - To check the official Game Version name, either find it in-game or follow the following steps on Heroic:
      1. Go to the game's page on Heroic Games Launcher
      2. Hover over the three-point menu button and click on `Modify Installation`
      3. Click on the checkbox next to `Keep the game at specific version`
      4. The selected version should be the one you have currently installed. Note the version and date of said version as Game Version.
  - Comet Version
    - Go by the version name in the Releases tab, of the version you downloaded.
    - Did you use Comet when it had no Releases available, or are you using a build that's not part of the releases? Mention (and possibly link) to the commit of the version you used.
  - GalaxyCommunication.exe Service Required
    - Test if the game does function with achievements and leaderboards/Comet. If it does not, try to install the service as you can [read in the dummy service documentation]](../../dummy-service/README.md).
    - If the service is required, fill in with `üü© Yes`. If the service is not required, fill in with `üî≤ No`.
  - GOG Galaxy Features
    - Fill in the `üü©` (working), `üî≤` (not present in-game) or `‚ùå` (not working) for the following features:
      - Achievements
      - Leaderboard
  - Notes
    - Any additional notes you would find important to mention with regards to the game compatibility. For example: possible issues, workarounds, specifics like switchable leaderboards between GOG and a different service.
