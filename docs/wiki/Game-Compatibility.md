# Game Compatibility

As this is a work-in-progress replacement, not all GOG Galaxy feature enabled games may function as expected. You can use `CTRL+F` to search for the game you would like to learn more about its compatibility.

## Contribute

To contribute, follow the Contribution Guidelines mentioned in the [Home Page of the Wiki](Home) and follow the following steps:

<details>
<summary>Steps</summary>

- Copy the last column of the table
- Edit the following information for your tested game compatibility:
  - Game Title (with the GOG storefront linked to it as a Hyperlink, in the following format: `[Game's name](GOG url here)`)
  - Game Version
    - To check the official Game Version name, either find it in-game or follow the following steps on Heroic:
      1. Go to the game's page on Heroic Games Launcher
      2. Hover over the three-point menu button and click on `Modify Installation`
      3. Click on the checkbox next to `Keep the game at specific version`
      4. The selected version should be the one you have currently installed. Note the version and date of said version as Game Version.
  - If the Native Linux Version works with Comet
      - Some games that do have a native Linux version available (not using Proton/WINE), still contain code for GOG features that remain unused unless used with Comet. If the game you tested does have a native Linux version, please do test if the Linux version does connect with Comet. 
  - Comet Version
    - Go by the version name in the Releases tab, of the version you downloaded.
    - Did you use Comet when it had no Releases available, or are you using a build that's not part of the releases? Mention (and possibly link) to the commit of the version you used.
  - GalaxyCommunication.exe Service Required
    - Test if the game does function with achievements and leaderboards/Comet. If it does not, try to install the service as you can [read in the dummy service documentation]](https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/tree/main/dummy-service/README.md).
    - If the service is required, fill in with `🟩 Yes`. If the service is not required, fill in with `🔲 No`.
  - GOG Galaxy Features
    - Fill in the `🟩` (working), `🔲` (not present in-game) or `❌` (not working) for the following features:
      - Achievements
      - Leaderboard
  - Notes
    - Any additional notes you would find important to mention with regards to the game compatibility. For example: possible issues, workarounds, specifics like switchable leaderboards between GOG and a different service.

| 🔲 | Not Available (Native Linux Version, GOG Galaxy Feature), Not Required (GalaxyCommunication.exe requirement)

| ❓| Unknown (GalaxyCommunication.exe requirement; in case of game-specific bugs that prevent Comet/GOG connection)

About `Native Linux Version Works`:

While GOG does not officially support GOG Galaxy features (achievements and leaderboards) for Linux versions of GOG games due to the lack of a Linux version of GOG Galaxy, some games that are multi-platform (having Windows and/or macOS versions, besides a native Linux version) still do have code in the Linux version to enable GOG Galaxy features. This connection is unused for Linux versions, but can get used by Comet. **Not all Linux versions do ship with unused/leftover GOG Galaxy connecting code, however.** Do not expect every native Linux version to work with Comet.
