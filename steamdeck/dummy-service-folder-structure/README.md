# Dummy Service Folder Structure

This folder is meant for the `comet-dummy-service.bat` installer when used under a Proton environment, such as managed by the Heroic Games Launcher. This allows the `.bat` script to install it in a specific location, without the end user having to dig into the folders themselves.
