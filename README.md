# Comet

Open Source implementation of GOG Galaxy's Communication Service

This project aims to implement calls made by game through SDK.  
Note: that means it can't and won't replace Communication Service in official client

This will provide minimal and platform-agnostic SDK. For use in game launchers like Heroic or Lutris

Project is continuation of Yepoleb's work [https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet/](https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet/) but in
~~Python~~ [now in Rust](https://github.com/imLinguin/comet/issues/15)

## How to use

Currently service supports small amount of calls, but these are enough to play Gwent for example.

Check [running](#running)

Some client SDK versions require Windows service to be registered, refer to [dummy service](./dummy-service/README.md)

### Authentication

You need to obtain `access_token`, `refresh_token` and `user_id` either manually, or by importing them:

#### Via [Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher)

Log in to GOG within the launcher.

#### Via [Lutris](https://github.com/lutris/lutris)

Log in to Lutris's GOG source.

#### Via [gogdl](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/heroic-gogdl) (CLI)

If GOG authentication has never been performed in Heroic on the current user, create the expected directory:

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/heroic/gog_store
```

Then, run the command:

```
./bin/gogdl --auth-config-path $HOME/.config/heroic/gog_store/auth.json auth --code <code>
```

Obtain the code by logging in using this URL, then copying the code value from the resulting URL:

https://login.gog.com/auth?client_id=46899977096215655&layout=galaxy&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fembed.gog.com%2Fon_login_success%3Forigin%3Dclient&response_type=code

### Running

```
comet --token "<access_token>" --refresh_token "<refresh_token>" --user-id <user_id> --username <USERNAME>
```

Or if you are using Heroic/gogdl

```
comet --from-heroic --username <USERNAME>
```

Or Lutris
```
comet --from-lutris --username <USERNAME>
```

Or use the shortcut script provided for non-Steam shortcuts. See the [Steam Deck Usage Guide](steamdeck/USAGE.md).

## Debugging SDK Client

In order to dump logging from SDK client download [GalaxyPeer.ini](https://items.gog.com/GalaxyPeer.zip),
when placed next to game .exe it will write GalaxyPeer.log when the game is running.
