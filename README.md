# Comet

Open Source implementation of GOG Galaxy's Communication Service

This project aims to implement calls made by game through SDK.  
Note: that means it can't and won't replace Communication Service in official client

This will provide minimal and platform agnostic SDK. For use in game launchers like Heroic or Lutris

Project is continuation of Yepoleb's work [https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet/](https://gitlab.com/Yepoleb/comet/) but in
Python

## Experimental support

Following requests are supported experimentally (they haven't been tested well)

- UPDATE_USER_STAT_REQUEST - no testing
- UNLOCK_USER_ACHIEVEMENT_REQUEST - able to avoid unlocking the achievement again (unsure about response status code)

## How to use

Currently service supports small amount of calls, but these are enough to play Gwent for example.

### Dependencies

Currently the only dependency is python protocolbuffers and aiohttp

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively you can install it using your Linux distro's package manager

### Authentication

You need to obtain `access_token`, `refresh_token` and `user_id` either manually, or by importing them:

#### Via [Heroic Games Launcher](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/HeroicGamesLauncher)

Log in to GOG within the launcher. Make sure to launch it before running Comet to ensure the credentials are refreshed.

#### Via [gogdl](https://github.com/Heroic-Games-Launcher/heroic-gogdl) (CLI)

If GOG authentication has never been performed in Heroic on the current user, create the expected directory:

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/heroic/gog_store
```

Then, run the command:

```
./bin/gogdl --auth-config-path $HOME/.config/heroic/gog_store/auth.json auth --code <code>
```

Obtain the code by logging in using this URL, then copying the code value from the resulting URL:

https://login.gog.com/auth?client_id=46899977096215655&layout=galaxy&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fembed.gog.com%2Fon_login_success%3Forigin%3Dclient&response_type=code

### Running

```
./bin/comet --token "<access_token>" --refresh_token "<refresh_token>" --user-id <user_id>
```

Or if you are using Heroic/gogdl

```
./bin/comet --from-heroic
```
